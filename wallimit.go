// SQLite starts the WAL over, from its first frame, when a writer finds
// every frame copied into the database and no reader on the WAL. While
// readers overlap there is no such moment: its checkpoints copy the frames,
// but the file grows as long as that lasts, and reads slow down with it.
//
// So a connection that gives the write lock back looks at the length of the
// WAL, and past the limit of its DSN (_wal_limit) it runs a RESTART
// checkpoint. That one waits: for the readers that hold frames back, then
// for those that still read the WAL, while new readers read the database
// file alone. It waits up to walWait, with the write lock held, so writers
// wait with it. When the readers do not end in time, as with a query no one
// closes, the next try comes once the WAL has grown by another quarter of
// the limit: the wait is paid once in that much writing, not at each commit.
//
// A file that is replicated is left alone here: its replicator runs the
// checkpoints (replica/internal/capture).

// defaultWALLimit is the length past which the driver starts the WAL over
// when the DSN has no _wal_limit.
